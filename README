nvim

===

This is my current (and constantly in-progress) configuration that I use on a
daily basis.

---

Requirements:
  - Neovim 0.11 (https://github.com/neovim/neovim), although I build from
    source because I like to live dangerously

  - Tested and working as of:

      NVIM v0.11.0-dev-1834+g56fabcadb6

---

Lazy.nvim profile output:

  Startuptime: 74.12ms

  Based on the actual CPU time of the Neovim process till UIEnter.
  This is more accurate than `nvim --startuptime`.
    LazyStart 3.69ms
    LazyDone  59.48ms (+55.8ms)
    UIEnter   74.12ms (+14.63ms)
