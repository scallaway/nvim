nvim

This is my current (and constantly in-progress) configuration that I use on a
daily basis.

---

Requirements:
	- NeoVim 0.8 (https://github.com/neovim/neovim)
		- although I build from source because I like to live 
	  	  dangerously
	- Packer.nvim (https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)

Make sure you have `packer` installed somewhere that is accessible to your
user (and your neovim configuration)
